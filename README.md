The Problem
In America, over 1/3 of the food we grow is never eaten. That wasted food is most often transported to landfills in our communities and left to decay in an anaerobic process that creates the potent greenhouse gas methane, which is 27â€“30 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. And thanks to a supply chain strain caused by the COVID pandemic, our food costs continue to rise dramatically. This also directly increases food insecurity for our neighbors.

We all have a critical role to play in this inefficient system. When we don't plan and manage our food well, we purchase more than we can consume and sometimes throw away food before it spoils. Expiration dates and proper food storage are also confusing, which only makes our problem worse.

The Solution
An approachable, streamlined kitchen and pantry management app that reminds you of what food you need to eat first to minimize your waste and stretch your grocery budget (think Rocket Money but for your kitchen). After scanning your grocery receipt, food will automatically be categorized and tagged with helpful storage tips.

Users can measure the financial impact of letting food go to waste with reports and customizable dashboards. This app takes a depoliticized stance by focusing on the cost of poor food management instead of the environmental impact. With a positive and easy-to-understand message, we can create a more sustainable and equitable food system for ourselves and our communities.
